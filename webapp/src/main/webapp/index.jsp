<h1> Hello, Welcome to Simple DevOps Project !!   </h1>
<h2> Hey Stu! Automated deployment worked - on a 15 min sched! Just confirming this is still working???? </h2>
<h2> Glad to see you here </h2>
<body>
  This was deployed to the image and is the actual index.jsp, not necessarily the webapp.war file??
  Well Stuart, why that is, Maven is doing a build based on pom.xml and in creating the webapp.war file.
